The mern-auth-project is a fundamental full-stack application utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) dedicated entirely to implementing robust user authentication. The project's core functionality involves defining API routes in Express.js for securely handling user registration and login, utilizing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to manage sessions and authorize requests, and hashing passwords with tools like bcrypt before storage in MongoDB. This setup provides a secure foundation for managing users and protecting specific content or features on the React frontend via protected routes.
